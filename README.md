## Concept
<b>Cell Escape</b> is a game inspired by a game that me and my friends play at lunch-time at school. <b>Cell Escape</b> is a basic game where there are two teams; Prisoners, and Guards.
### Guards
The guards in <b>Cell Escape</b> pick a route and follow it, and also at the start there would be a vote on who will carry a key. If the guard notices that a (and/or all) prisoner(s) are gone then they will be granted the permision to stop their current route. If a guard hears a noise the he/she will be granted the ability to walk over to the source of the noise. If the guard sees movement then they can walk/run over to see what it was. If you die you will be able to spectate but not communicate with other guards. If you get stunned you will be frozen for a two second period. If you die and you <b>DON'T</b> have the key, then that's good, but if you do have the key then the prosoners can make a break for it until either they reach the end or they get killed or stunned. While you are walking in your routine you will be able to swap who has the key if your routes clash. While picking your route you can see other's routes. You can rechoose you route but you will be on cooldown. <b> I might add more to this but I think this is enough for now.</b>
### Prisoners
Prisoners must try to kill one of the guards which will be selected to have a key (note: finish writing this)
