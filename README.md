# Cell Escape
Made with [Unity 3D](unity3d.com). Copyright (c) Jakob de Guzman 2018.
## Concept
<b>Cell Escape</b> is a game inspired by a game that me and my friends play at lunch-time at school. <b>Cell Escape</b> is a basic game where there are two teams; Prisoners, and Guards.
### Guards
The guards in <b>Cell Escape</b> pick a route and follow it, and also at the start there would be a vote on who will carry a key. If the guard notices that a (and/or all) prisoner(s) are gone then they will be granted the permision to stop their current route. If a guard hears a noise the he/she will be granted the ability to walk over to the source of the noise. If the guard sees movement then they can walk/run over to see what it was. If you die you will be able to spectate but not communicate with other guards. If you get stunned (note: finish writing this)
### Prisoners
Prisoners must try to kill one of the guards which will be selected to have a key (note: finish writing this)
